# Puzzles

Puzzles is a social media platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Users can create an account, post status updates and images on their social media wall, add and remove friends, and toggle between dark and light mode. The app uses the bcrypt package for authentication and authorization, jsonwebtoken for creating JSON web tokens, Multer for handling form data, and Mongoose for defining database schemas.
